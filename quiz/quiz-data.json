                    "It always uses structured metadata",
                    "It directly matches user text queries to terms in unstructured documents",
                    "It relies on image recognition algorithms",

                "correct": 1,
                "explanation": "Text retrieval matches user-entered text queries directly to terms in unstructured documents, minimizing issues caused by semantic interpretation."

                "correct": 1,
                "explanation": "Boolean retrieval determines relevance for each document independently and does not require a post-processing ranking step."

                "correct": 2,
                "explanation": "Faceted search was added to help users navigate large result sets by applying filters and sorting without changing document relevance."

                "question": "In the offline indexing phase, what is the primary purpose of the 'split' step?",
                "options": [
                    "To tokenize text into words and subwords",
                    "To divide long documents into smaller coherent retrieval units",
                    "To normalize character encodings to UTF-8",

                "correct": 1,
                "explanation": "Overlapping text ensures that query terms at chunk boundaries are captured together, reducing false negatives."

                    "It stays constant regardless of rank",
                    "It increases linearly with r",

                ],
                "correct": 2,
                "explanation": "Zipf’s law states that term probability is inversely proportional to its rank, p(r) = c/r."
