# Chapter 4: Advanced Text Processing
We study how to extract improved text features, examine tokenization strategies for machine learning, and discuss various linguistic analysis and transformation methods.

### Demos

- [Setup libraries and dataset](00-setup.ipynb): run this once for all the demos in this chapter
- [Introduction](01-introduction.ipynb): showing a rule based approach to understand language
- [Tokenization](02-tokenization.ipynb): different implementations for tokenization from classical word to modern sub-word extraction
- [LLM Tokenization](03-llm-tokens.ipynb): different implementations for tokenization for large language models
- [N-grams](04-ngrams.ipynb): automatically identifying good n-grams in a text corpus
- [Lemmatization](05-lemmatization.ipynb): stemming, compunds, synonyms, homonyms, etc
- [Part of Speech (POS)](06-part-of-speech.ipynb): annotating words with part-of-speech tag and recognition of named entities (NER)
