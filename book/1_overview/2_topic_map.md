  - Description

* - Foundation
  - 1 Introduction
  - We cover motivation, a summary of history, the generic retrieval process and its variations, a quick overview of metadata, and view demos to get us started

* - 
  - 2 Evaluation
  - We focus on evaluating and comparing retrieval systems and machine learning approaches. This serves as the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the methods covered in most of the chapters

* - 
  - 11 ML Methods\*
  - We cover essential machine learning methods as needed for content analysis and the extraction of metadata items. As we progress through the course, we will visit individual chapters as need
  
* - Text & Web Retrieval
  - 3 Classic
  - We explore classical text retrieval models, with a particular emphasis on vector space retrieval. We also delve into Lucene, OpenSearch and Elasticsearch which showcase the capabilities of these models

* - 
  - 4 Advanced
  - We examine natural language processing using NLTK as an example. Additionally, we explore contemporary methods for creating embeddings and leveraging generative AI to improve results

* - 
  - 5 Web & Social
  - We focus on web and social media retrieval, particularly examining methods to influence rankings based on the relationships between documents

* - 
  - 6 Vector Search
  - We explore the challenge of searching through embeddings and feature vectors. We discuss the "curse of dimensionality" and study contemporary techniques used by products like Lucene, OpenSearch, and Elasticsearch

* - Image Retrieval
  - 7 Basic
  - We cover the human perception of visual signal information and examine several algorithms for extracting features that describe color, texture, and shape aspects found in the images

* - 
  - 8 Advanced
  - We delve into neural networks and explore the concept of deep learning. We apply these techniques to extract higher-level features, including classifications, facial recognition, and object bounding boxes

* - Audio Retrieval
  - 9 Basic
  - We cover the human perception of audio signals and study various algorithms for extracting features in both the time and frequency domains. Additionally, we delve into the unique case of extracting musical features
  
* - Video Retrieval
  - 10 Basic
  - We discuss fundamental elements of motion detection and video segmentation. Specifically, we focus on identifying shot and scene boundaries in videos

For exams, Chapter 11 requires the understanding of high-level concepts, basic formulas, and algorithms for each method. It's important that you can explain their applications for retrieval and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. You don't need to memorize formulas and algorithms beyond the basics concepts.
