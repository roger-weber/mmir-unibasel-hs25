:::{admonition} Theory
:class: note dropdown
Please review the course material before each class. During the lessons, we will cover the main points, but some details will be left for independent study to maintain an efficient pace. Keep track of the schedule and announcements in ADAM. As a general guideline, try to stay ahead in the readings.

:::{admonition} Practice
:class: note dropdown
During the third hour, we engage in both theoretical and practical exercises. We explore Python and software packages relevant to the retrieval topics covered in class. While this part is optional, active participation can help improve your exam performance (more details on the following page). We do not provide special materials - instead, we refer to public tutorials when possible to introduce software packages. You are welcome to join with a curious mindset and ask questions.
