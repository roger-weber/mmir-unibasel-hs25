Each object in the representation relates to a sub-expression in the query that is evaluated in a stream-based manner. By composition, we can aggregate atomic queries over terms to arbitrarily complex Boolean queries. We introduce a class ``Term`` to denote atomic queries, 2 classes ``And`` and ``Or`` that represent the boolean operators with an arbitrary number of operands (which can be of type ``Term``, ``And``, and ``Or``). Finally, we also define a class ``Not`` that acts on a single sub-expression (again of any sub-type). However, we do not allow nesting of ``Not``, and only ``And`` expression can have a sub-expression with ``Not`` (and must have at leas one subexpression without ``Not``). Our implentation of ``Not`` is to mark sub-expression, but the class has no way to evaluate itself."

    "To evaluate a query like \"cat AND dog\", we fetch the first entry for each term, that is `1` for cat and `3` for dog. If they are the same, we know that the corresponding document fulfills the predicate. If not, then we read the next entry for the term currently having the smallest doc ID. In our example, we read the next cat posting which is `4`. Again, we have no match, so we progress now postings of dog as it currently has the smallest value. The next posting for dog is `4` which matches with the one of cat; hence, we found our first document and return it (in Python we use generators with `yield` as we also do not want to return all results at once but in batches as the user browses through pages). If we need more results to return, we now fetch the next posting for both terms and repeat. Finally, we find `10` and return it as a second answer. If we need more results, we again fetch the next posting for both terms. But since cat does not have more postings, we can terminate the evaluation and stop iteration (dog still has `12` but we already know from the empty cat postings that it cannot match the query). The following visualizes the approach:\n",

    "|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |\n",
    "| 1 | `1` | `3` | no match, progress cat |\n",

    "| 5 | `10` | `10` | match, return `10` as result, wait to provide next result, and progress both cat and dog |\n",
    "| 6 | - | `12` | stop iteration as all cat postings are visited; remaining postings in dog cannot fulfill predicate |"

    "Finally, we can apply the same approach for arbitrary nesting of AND and OR operators since each evaluation scheme above yields document IDs again in a sorted manner. As with atomic term queries, we can only support NOT operators if they are part of an AND expression which at least has one sub-expression without a NOT at the top-level (a nested NOT deeper in the sub-expression is not a problem)."
